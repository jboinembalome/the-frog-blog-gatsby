Hi üëã  
Today I have prepared a top x of the best sites to help you in your projects all sorted by category

## HTML / CSS

### FANCY-BORDER-RADIUS
The first site is [FANCY-BORDER-RADIUS](https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/#30.39.30.30--.) 
that will allow you to create abstract forms for your sites :

### Colorable
Second site, [Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/000e66/e1ff00)
This site allows you to test different text colors on different backgrounds. A good way to get an idea of how to choose the colors of your site.

### Gradient Magic
[Gradient Magic](https://www.gradientmagic.com/), A Free Gallery of Fantastic and Unique CSS Gradients, Really nice to use and allows to change the white background.

### Gate waves
[Gate waves](https://getwaves.io/),
To create small waves and make your sites less linear

## Framework CSS
At the moment I am rather turning web, and I must say that two css frameworks marked me a little 

### Bulma
The first one is [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), 
it's a rather known framework but I find it simple to set up and easy to use.
With it, no excuse, you'll make sites faster than your shadow and go to bed

### TailwindCSS
The second one, my favorite, is [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
I made this blog with it and several other sites too. To try it is to adopt it 

> A little more complicated to set up but nothing to worry about, I met
> some difficulties when I wanted to use it for this blog with HUGO but
> you learn and you get there!

## Library JS


### [Greensock JS](https://greensock.com/), 
the best JS animation library
it has been around for more than 10 years and is always updated.
This library will allow you to make incredible animations. 
I even used them several times, between the video available on youtube of the Greensock channel and the community you will always find your answers 

> Often associated with ScrollTrigger

### [Typewriterjs](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs), 
To achieve a small typewriter effect,
there are also a lot of videos on youtube that can help

## Bonus

### [Open Peeps](https://www.openpeeps.com/), 
I didn't know which category to put it in, but Open peeps offers you beautiful black and white illustrations for your website with a touch of originality. Very qualitative PNG or SVG

### [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations), 
In the same genre as Open Peeps but with more color
